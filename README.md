# GameDev-24-25 Project Demo and Script Repository
  If you're reading this! Welcome to the 2024-2025 Game Developemnt Club! We're glad to see you here.
## Project Description
  This repository is a unity file I made to display a variety of common mechanics that are used in 2D unity games, whether it be a top-down or a side-scroller. This project is optimized for a top-down game, but many of the scripts are interchangible with some modification to your needs. This includes basic movement, projectiles, and aiming. While not meant to replace the need to code and develop your own scripts, these files should make it easier to understand and begin working on your games. 

  As of 02/10/2024, there are two folders "Side Scroller" and "Top Down"
    They feature different examples of movement, so please use the code that is more relevant to the project you intend to make.
#  How To Use
  The entire repository contains the relevant information to the entire unity file, including metadata - which is most likely not needed if you wish to use this code in your own projects. To access the scripts, enter the folder labelled "Side Scroller" or "Top Down" the scripts are under:
  
  ***"Project Name" / Assets / Scripts***

To use these scripts, either download the file using the button from the top right of the screen, or copy the text into a Visual Studio file.

These files are not meant to be copied 1-1 into your projects; rather, they should serve as a tool to learn some functions in unity and should be modified to serve your specific needs. If you need assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me.

### Common Issues with Using Code with this Repository

  The text at the top of each script is will look something like this:

        using System.Collections;
        using System.Collections.Generic;
        using UnityEngine;
        
        public class Aiming_and_Firing_2D : MonoBehaviour

The top three lines will usually be the same between files, but the part between ***Public Class*** and ***: MonoBehaviour*** is the name of the script - In this case, ***_Aiming_And_Firing_2D***. Whatever you name the script in Unity, it must be the same as the script name in Visual Studio. When copying code over, ensure that you change one of the names to fit, otherwise you may see an error message similar to this one:

# Software 
This file was made using Unity 2021.3.11f1 (LTS), but the using code should not prove to be an issue in other versions.
